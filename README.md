# PayPal Opportunity Hacks 2019 Hackathon
This code was developed for the Chandler Care center to assist in patient registration. It serves as a patient DB and includes a reactive web-based app targeting tablets which can be used by patients to register and sign-in. Further changes were made over the course of 2020 and 2021 and the finalized code was delivered to the Chandler Care Center.

The app is built with Angular and Springboot. Please be aware that this repo contains the code that was developed during the event. A new private repo was created and used to track changes occurring after the event.
